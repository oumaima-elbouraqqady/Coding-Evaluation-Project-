# Coding-Evaluation-Project-
This project focuses on the Design and Development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB for encoding images using the Shannon-Fano and Huffman coding algorithms. The GUI enables users to easily encode images and compare the performance of these two popular compression techniques in terms of compression ratio, encoding efficiency, and output file size. The tool provides an intuitive interface for selecting input images, visualizing encoded data, and analyzing the differences between Shannon-Fano and Huffman approaches. This project serves as an educational platform to understand and evaluate lossless image compression methods.
